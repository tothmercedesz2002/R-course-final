# üêæ About the dataset üêæ

The dataset includes data about the London Fire Brigade's **animal rescues** since **January 2009**. As provided in the official dataset description, in **2020**, there was a **20% increase** in rescues compared to 2019. The biggest increase was observed among **non-domestic animals**.

Codebook available [here.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2021/2021-06-29/readme.md)

# üêæ Goals of this analysis üêæ

In this analysis, I will:
- prepare the dataset, compute variables and visualize them;  
- confirm the rise in rescues by plotting;  
- compare the number of domestic and non-domestic animal rescues in 2020 by plotting and t-test;  
- look for correlations between variables of interest;  
- investigate whether non-domestic animals' rescue costs more money than domestic animals' rescue by fitting a linear regression model;  
- investigate what other factors influence rescue cost with a more complex linear regression model;  
- compare the simple and the more complex models' performance.

In both models, the **outcome** variable will be incident_notional_cost.

In the more complex model, I will include the following **predictors**:  
- day_or_night: computed from date_time_of_call (0: day, 1: night);  
- pump_count: number of trucks needed for the rescue;    
- pump_hours_total: length of rescue operation;  
- domestic_wild: computed from animal_group_parent (0: domestic; 1: wild);  
- borough_inner_outer: computed from borough based on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs) (0: inner; 1: outer).
