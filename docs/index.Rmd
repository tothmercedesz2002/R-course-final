# 🐾 About the dataset 🐾
The dataset includes data about the London Fire Brigade's **animal rescues** since **January 2009**. As provided in the official dataset description, in **2020**, there was a **20% increase** in rescues compared to 2019. The biggest increase was observed among **non-domestic animals**.

# 🐾 Goals of this analysis 🐾
In this analysis, I will:
- confirm the rise in rescues in 2020;
- compare the rise in domestic and non-domestic animal rescues in 2020;
- investigate whether non-domestic animals' rescue costs more money  than domestic animals' rescue by fitting linear regression model
- investigate what other factors influence rescue cost with a more complex linear regression model
- compare the simple and the more complex models' performance
